# Sequential Turn Table Project

This project simulates a sequential turn table system developed using Siemens S7-1200 PLC and TIA Portal. The simulation is performed in Factory IO.

- **Turn Table Function:** A single function block (FB) was written to control the turn table. This function ensures that the turn table stops at designated positions and moves sequentially.
- **Sequential Turn Table:** The turn table function was used twice in the project to control two different turn tables. These two turn tables work in sequence to simulate the material handling process.
- **Simulation:** The simulation of the project was conducted in the Factory IO environment.

## Requirements

- Siemens TIA Portal vXX
- Siemens S7-1200 PLC
- Factory IO vXX

## Setup and Usage

1. Open the project files in TIA Portal.
2. Download and run the PLC program.
3. Load the appropriate scenario in Factory IO and establish a connection with the PLC.
4. Start the simulation and observe the sequential operation of the turn tables.
